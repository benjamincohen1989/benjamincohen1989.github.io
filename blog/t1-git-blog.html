<h1>Version Control: Git and Github</h1>
<h2><i>The heck are these?</i></h2>

So you're probably wondering, what the heck is version control? Think of it like this. When you write an essay you want to keep tabs on your progress. So every once in a while you save your document as a new version, say, v1, v2, v3 etc. That way you can track your changes and have safe versions without having to worry that new changes will ruin the entire project. Well, the same desire to work safely exists for developers as well! However, developers, being the geeks they are, came up with a much more techy way of doing this.

Git is the safeguard solution. Think of it as a time machine. It allows you to save copies of your files and then, over time, upload new versions that track exactly what changes have been made. It does this by offering what is essentially multiple save choices. You have your master copy and basically check it out to make edits. Once you feel like those edits are something you want to keep you merge them back into the master. You can have multiple copies being edited at once if you want to experiment, and then you just take what you like most when you go to merge the copies back together.

I hear you, you're saying to yourself "Ben, that's great. But is it limited to just me working by myself?" Not at all! That's where Github comes in. Github basically takes your files from git and allows you to save them online. This would allow others to check out your files and provide additions of their own. You could have literally hundred of people working on one file and sending in their edits without fear of ruining your original master file. This is infinitely helpful to businesses and large scale development projects. The work can be easily split without fear of corrupt files. It also means that you can access your files from anywhere, a la Dropbox. Having that repository makes your files available anywhere and with open source agreements who knows what will come of what you put out there! You never know how helpful others can be till you let them in!
