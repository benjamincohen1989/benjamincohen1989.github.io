<h1>Stereotype Trap</h1>
<h2>Yea, I bet you KNEW I'd be that way</h2>

I wouldn't say I have much personal experience with the stereotype trap. Thats not to say there aren't stereotypes about people with my background. I'm white and come from a good family. Sure, some people out there may assume that those two things played a large role in where I am now. They might say I got into the schools I got into based on that. Maybe they assume I didn't have to work as hard as others. Who knows and honestly, who cares?

The challenge of this trap is that its easy for each of US to think that we're in it. At the end of the day there is a stereotype for everything. The question becomes, how do we compare them? The truth is, prejudice exists everywhere and many people face real stereotypes vs. my perceived stereotypes. I have not faced the same challenges as a poor, minority student. Period. And it would be wrong for me to think that I am a victim in the same way.

So how can I help? Well I for one believe that dialogue is a part of any solution. Discussions of stereotypes and traps are meant to be had as a group. Louis CK has a great bit about kids bullying each other. He says that every kid has to have a time as a bully and a time of being bullied. They have to know how it feels, and see how it hurts. Same with stereotyping. We have to have large group discussions, be open and honest and be willing to admit when we see cards stacked against others.
