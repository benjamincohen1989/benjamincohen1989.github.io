One thing is incredibly clear after finishing Phase 0: You need to know how to ask a question. I would say for the most part I'm good with that. I've gone back through the Google+ community and through the various things I've searched for online and would say for the most part I'm capable in the searching field.
</p>
<p>
But why is it so important? Well, there is the standard, incredibly simple answer that you need to be able to describe whats wrong in order for the person to know how to help you. But in a more nuanced sense, these are whole new languages and that means whole new keywords. Going through stackoverflow its clear that there is a way of speaking, a way of phrasing. Understanding that has been key to finding the answers that I need.
</p>
<p>
All that said, one can always ask better questions. I'm a guy who is never afraid to ask if I don't get something and I'm looking forward to being able to do this in person for a change. Tomorrow is a whole new world.
