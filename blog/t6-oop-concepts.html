<h1>Class vs Module</h1>
<h2>Pray tell, what is the difference?</h2>

So you want to know about classes vs. modules. Well, these two important Ruby functions share a couple of key similarities and a whole host of important differences. To give a basic overview, think of modules as a library. They are about providing methods that you can use across a whole host of classes. Some good examples of when modules might come in handy are authentication and authorization systems. You want them to work across multple classes so you don't want your important methods trapped in an individual class, or needing to be re-writen for each usage. Classes on the other hand are all about objects. They are about instances (though modules CAN be used for instance methods), useful when you want to create instances of object itself, or simply objects in general. Classes define the behavior of those specific objects, rather than allowing control over all objects.

Thats the overview (and most of what you need to know) but there are a few more tidbits worth thinking about. Module methods have don't have inheritance like classes do, but they do let you use inclusion and extensions. To learn more, check out this handy Stackoverflow discussion:
