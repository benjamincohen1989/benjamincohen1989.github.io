Net neutrality. Sounds ominous, right? Who is at war and why is the net remaining neutral? Damn net, can't even choose a side. It's like the Irish in WWII. I mean...HOW....could you not choose a side there? Anyways, net neutrality is a critical issue facing the tech community, and really the greater world as a whole. It really comes down to a fundamental question of how we view technology, or more specifically, how we view the internet and the data that passes back and forth each day.

To frame this argument, lets look at something completely different. Lets look at electricity. Now, the electric company charges you based on how much elecricity you uses. It's a simple number, a total of all of your usage. They can't (forget the technical challenge, just assume for a second they COULD) charge you different rates on HOW you want to use that electricity. They can't for instance say, "Well, that guy really uses his computer a lot. It shows it is vitally important to him and therefore we can bet his willingness to pay will be higher so charge prices based on where exactly the energy is used."
</p>
<p>
Well, internet providers in this case CAN do that sort of price discrimination. They know how you spend your bandwidth. They have data on your favorite sites and on the sites that use the most of their precious, precious data. The same goes for businesses. The internet companies have only so much bandwidth to give. Why shouldn't they be allowed to sell their services to the highest bidder. After all, internet is a commodity. Why should it be regulated as if its a universal right?
</p>
<p>
Well, this is where the picture gets a little complicated. As most of you probably thought right off the bat, I too jumped to the belief that hey, companies should be allowed to put the internet to the market. Let the market dictate the correct price. After all, AMERICA. No, but seriously...AMERICA! WE BELIEVE IN MARKETS. YAY MARKETS.
</p>
<p>
But hold on there a second bucko, think for a second what this really means.This means that the internet providers can look up your 5 favorite sites and dictate the price as applies directly to you. They can look at your bandwidth use and just jack up the prices.  That may not sound revolutionary as pricing goes, but it is. Assume for a second those are the sites you are going to want to use for the rest of time. What is to stop the provider from continually raising prices on you?  Well, turns out nothing would. Once data is a consumer to consumer market you pretty much lose your pricing protections.

Ok, ok, so maybe that shouldn't be the case for individual consumers. But what about businesses. After all, why should all businesses get equal access. Well, again, lets think of this like a monopoly, which is really what it would be. The internet companies could make "fast lanes" and basically gouge business to pony up. Facebook with its billions of dollars might be willing to, but what do you do if you have a startup? How are you going to be able to afford the speeds your company may need to give its users the right experience. You'd be priced out of the market before you even began.
</p>
<p>
And thats where we hit problems. Turns out the internet doesn't really work well as a market commodity. Perhaps its best to think of it like a highway. We all use them. Sure, some use them more than others, but imagine what would happen if your company had to pay a fee just to get the employees to work. Imagine if you couldn't afford to put your car on the road to ship your product. That, over the long run, stifles business. It increases monopolies, reduces competition and destroyes user choice. Yes, at the end of the day, net neutrality protects us. It keeps data and how data is classified as NEUTRAL. This keeps us all safe and keeps business humming. So don't be stupid, keep the net neutral.
