Cycles, Cycles, Cycles. But what do cycles....doooo.....dude? Pretty sure Jesus asked that in his message to the Corinthians. Could have also been Winston Churchill or perhaps even Lincoln at Gettysburg. Either way, cycles have CLEARLY been the rage for generations. I get it. And the kids these days just don't have a full appreciation for this old timey gem. I can hear them now. "We don't need you, old man. Your cycles thing brings nothing to the table. YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD."

Well they are ALL WRONG. You do need cycles. They are a wonderfully nifty tool. Hell, I could take in this constant criticism and quickly shoot back "Lalala I can't hear you!" four or five times without having to write it all out. This gift for repetition can be wildly useful. Sure, you aren't always going to want to just repeat the same phrase, over and over again, but this cycle can be stored for use down the road.
