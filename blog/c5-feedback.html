<h1>Feedback on Feedback</h1>

Feedback, feedback, feedback. In theory we all want it. In truth, we generally only want it when it is glowing. Sure, it helps us grow blah blah blah blah blah. But how do I reeeeally feel about it?
<p>
Personally I like pairing with people. I like it because as a new coder I feel safer, if you will, in the coding environment when I have a buddy. It lets me run my ideas off somebody, lets me get immediate help when I need it (which often times DBC doesn't offer) and helps me feel closer to the people that I'm going to soon be coding in person with.

But that's pairing. Pairing, in this case, is very different than feedback. This is where the situation, to me, gets murkier. The logic of pairing is that working together decreases errors. We want to get better at vocalizing and editing in real time, trusting others enough to work with each other. So then what is this feedback system? Annonymous snipits? Doesn't that run counter to the logic of the pairing system? Doesn't that suggest that, hey, you should feel comfortable enough to work together, to edit each other, but not to share how we can each improve. The truth of it is, the business community is not an annonymous community. There are no hidden spaces from which to lob critique. So why do we allow that here? On the job we will be judged in real time. Your boss will tell you when and where your code is not up to snuff. Harsh? Maybe. But who cares, the world is harsh, better gets used to it.

<p>
Which brings me back to where this started. I love pairing and think it builds wonderful skills. However, I think by taking the actual critique out of it we lose some of the value. We should be adult enough to speak openly and honestly with each other. Sure, I can imagine some people saying "But this will get you more honest feedback because people won't be scared of seeing you hurt." Is that really the point? Are we so PC that we can't have people learn to take coding criticism and bounce back, stronger than before?

Basically, DBC, take off the kiddie gloves. You have seen fit to allow us to have to self teach a lot of this. That is fine and while a pain in the ass, it is good for us. We learn how to google again, learn how to read tech texts etc. We must be thrown into the water to learn how to swim. Throw us in the water again. Let us duke it out. Let some feelings be hurt. This will make us stronger, and ultimately better coders.
