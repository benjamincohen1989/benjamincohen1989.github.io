<h1>Ben's First Thoughts</h1>
<h2>Or: How I learned to stop worrying and trust in the system</h2>
<h4>March 5, 2015</h4>
<section>
<p>
Being so new to coding, at first I didn't really know what to think. I went from not really knowing much of anything to trying to troubleshoot git, which seemed impossible at first and I'll be honest, a couple of hours in I questioned whether or not I had made the right decision to do this program. I can tell from looking at the Google+ group that people have started to build a community, and being a late add I wondered if I had already missed the boat. A week is so short but so very long at the same time, especially since I'm in a very different timezone to most people so its easy to feel disconnected.
</p>
<p>
It didn't help that at first I struggled. Things didn't install properly, code wasn't working and git was not being my friend. And then it happened. Slowly but surely things started to work. I'm not saying its been perfect, because I still have to really think through a lot of my actions, but its starting to come more naturally. I'm starting to....get it....I know, I know, famous last words. But in that way my expectations have changed. Before I had reservations that I could really succeed in any coding program but now I feel confident. There is so much left to learn but just getting git under my belt feels great.
</p>
<p>
Am I nervous? Not at all. I'm so excited to be part of this community and I can't wait to be in the same place as everybody. I can already feel what learning coding is going to do for me and how its going to open my world in new and exciting ways.
