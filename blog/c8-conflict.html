<h1>An Example of Conflict</h1>
<h2>Hey, it happens to everybody</h2>
<h4>April 18, 2015</h4>

<p>
I had a conflict with a person who worked for me in my last job. We were under a bit of a time crunch, trying to get back some very important reporting to a client, and this guy basically started to break under the pressure. He lashed out at me, telling me that I should just do his work, demanding to know what I, his boss, was working on at the moment that prevented me from doing his stuff. Suffice to say I was not thrilled with this issue. We ended up yelling at each other in the office, not a good thing to have happen no matter the situation.

In the end the source of the conflict, in my mind was two-fold. I think first he was cracking under the pressure and wasn't showing it well. And second, I think on a base level he didn't like that the guy who was managing him was 6 years younger than him. I was beyond annoyed and very much wanted to just fire him on the spot but I went for a walk instead. Walked around the block a few times, went and got coffee and just did everything possible to cool off.

The way this got resolved was by bringing in my boss, the head of the company to mediate. He is a fair person and I knew his voice in the end was needed to end the conflict.Sometimes sides just don't agree so you need a third party, which can be extremely helpful.After the discussions with him we shook hands and it was over. In the end I'm actually pretty happy with how I handled it, going for a walk, seeking advice from mentors etc. I think that is a good strategy and one I hope to continue utilizing in the future.
