<h1>The Values of My Life</h1>
<h2>What is the value to choosing?</h2>
<h4>April 14, 2015</h4>

<p>
The values I'm going to talk to you about today are pretty simple: adventure, creativity, courage, integrity, persistence and wisdow. I've picked these because I feel that they are the most important values in my life, currently. Does that mean that others aren't important? Goodnesss no. But some of these have a time and a place, and some of them will always be boiling just below the surface, adding additional structure to how I build my life.
</p>
<p>
But if I had to pick one, I'd have to go with wisdom. To me wisdom is more encompassing than a lot of the other ones. Wisdom takes many of these other values in order to be true. You cannot be wise without being knowledgeable or creative, adventurous or having integrity. I view it as fundamental to leading a full life.

The last thing somebody asked my advice about was jobs. I had a long conversation with a young graduate about the merits of working abroad. As a person who spent the last year working in China I feel like I have a strong understanding of this decision and good advice to share. It certainly relates to the values I find important, but also goes to show how they are all connected. I feel like it was my wisdom on living abroad that was sought, but this was possible because this person considers me a loyal and trustworthy person to talk with.

I think I do tend to fall back on my values in tough times, but I think our values should be our ultimate source of confidence. Over time, as we grow older and wiser, I think we become clearer in our minds as to which words really fit us, and that offers a sense of security in a crazy world. Knowing that we're loyal, for instance, can help us in fights with friends. Knowing you're smart can give you confidence to take on new challenges. I 100% feel like keeping my values in mind helps me move forward in this world.
