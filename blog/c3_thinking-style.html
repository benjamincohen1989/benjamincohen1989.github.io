<h1>Three Weeks In</h1>
<h2>Man, this is harder than it looks</h2>
<h4>March 17, 2015</h4>

<p>
I would definitely say that the first two weeks felt like a breeze compared to week 3. This week was really challenging for me, and a lot of it has to do with how I learn best (at least how I think I do).
</p>
<p>
I'm the type of learner that really benefits from seeing something done in person and getting to ask instructors questions in real time. In that respect, Phase 0 of DBC is incredibly challenging for me. I have been working really hard on each of the weeks and the exercises but the temptation to walk away when things get hard is always there. I like being in a class and needing to be on my game. I like having the teacher there reinforcing each piece of information, making sure that I'm not getting ahead of myself. With that in mind, I'm setting some goals for myself moving forward. We still have quite some time before the in person section starts, but I can be proactive now, spending more time in office hours and running through concepts that I've found challenging. I tried really hard to do that this week and definitely felt like I benefited from it. It's something I liked, something that I think really helped me and something that I plan on continuing. In that vein, I want to do more to work with other members of the community. Not just pairing but really going through concepts and working through things that challenge me. This is one of the first subjects I've really not had a knack for and so I have to teach myself to ask for help more often. That is new for me but it is something I want to get better at.

In another effort to be more well rounded in my learning style I've been trying to force myself to be more grounded in the book for now. I love experimenting and often feel like it helps me a lot, but without that in person support it can be easy for me to lose my way. I've gotten a lot good information from our resources and want to make sure that I'm really technically sound before I journey out there. It can be tough to force myself to slog through the readings and like I mentioned, that temptation to just walk away for a bit is always there, but this method is something I want to get better at and I plan on really working on it.

Despite the recent struggles I feel good about where I am and am excited for Unit 2. Bring on new headaches! :-)
