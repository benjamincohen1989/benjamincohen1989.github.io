<h1>Margins, Borders and Padding</h1>
<h2>What do you mean these aren't all the same?</h2>

So you wanna know about margins, borders and padding? Well, you've come to the right place. I know what you're thinking. "I put this into Google and THIS is what came up? The hell is this guy?" Well, I'm the guy that is going to explain all this to you. Simmer down. Kids these days, with their skateboards and their rock and roll. No respect.
</p>
<p>
So lets say you've painted a nice, new painting. Who knows, maybe it's a boat or something. Whatever it is, I'm guessing it ain't going into the Met, but maybe, just maybe your parents will be nice enough to hang it up on their wall. They need to figure out where on the wall to put the damn thing. Well, for objects on websites there is a similar debate. 
</p>
<p>
Let's say you have an image you want to put onto your webpage. You wouldn't wanna just throw it on there all willy-nilly, would you? No, you'd want to think through where it goes, just like your parents do. In order to do this you need a few pieces of information. First, you need to figure out the dimensions of your picture. Thats the content. Then, lets say your parents wanna put a nice frame around it. Well, sometimes the frame doesnt' come right up to the picture. Often there is a bit of paper in between the frame and the picture. That's the padding. Same goes for your picture on the website. You wouldn't wanna put your border right up against the picture. That looks weird. So you give it....some padding (I assume you were saying it with me). So you got your picture, then your padding then your border.
</p>
<p>
Now you've got the picture all nice and framed. But its a bit wall. You gotta be specific on where you wanna put it. That's where margin comes in. The margin is basically just the space between the wall and each side of the picture. Imagine telling your parents where to hang up your piece of art. "Three feet from the top, six feet from the right, five from the bottom and 4 from the left." Thats the margins. From frame/border to the wall/edge of the site. Makes sense? If it doesn't here's a picture. And if THAT doesn't make sense....well then I give up.
