<h1>Hashes and Arrays: Friend or Foe?</h1>

Hashes and arrays are in many ways two paths to the same destination. Each of them allows you to take individual pieces of data, package them together into one handy dandy variable and do nifty things with the group of data as a whole. Each of them is entered into the system as a list, which your computer then remembers in order. Lets say I'm thinking of pet names. I can create an array or hash of the names (Toto, Bud, Lassie), call it pet_names and the computer will remember them as a group. Let's say I want to call out Bud specifically, I just inform the computer that I want the value in the 1 position (Computers start counting at 0. Why? Because they're computer and don't care what you think.)
</p>
<p>
So you're now thinking, hey, this seems pretty easy and those two seem basically interchangeable. NOPE. THINK AGAIN. Ok, similar yes. Interchangeable no. And in some pretty crucial ways. Some programmers would argue that there are more functions you can do with arrays, that if you have the full Ruby spectrum under your belt there is just more user options. Let's just say that at this point in our training, we don't have that full knowledge. No, for us the real difference is in usability.

Arrays are certainly wonderful, but their downfall is that in order to call a specific value you need to remember the exact location, in order, of that value. Knowing I want the pet name Bud doesn't really help me if I can't remember which spot in the order it is! Therein lies the rub. When it comes to long lists arrays start to fall short. The user is expected to remember exact locations and very often that is extremely difficult if not impossible. It may come down to it that I can't remember where I put the darn thing and have to actually go and change a preexisting value to Bud, or even add it to the very end and calculate how many values in the string so I know what to call. Pain in the butt, right? Have no fear, this is where hashes shine.

<p>
Hashes, like arrays are technically indexed numerically. I can call for the 3rd position in my hash and get whatever I put in there. First come first serve, just like arrays. But here is where hashes different. Unlike arrays, you get to classify hashes by adding ID tags. Let's saying I'm trying to remember all of my pets names. I have a dog, cat, spider, bird, fish etc. Now I can label the name of each pet by their species. Cool, right? So when I call for my dogs name, all I have to do is call for dog and the name comes right out. No more trying to remember where in the list I put the darn thing, I just have to remember how I labeled it. With simple labeling all of the values become easy to find. This capability for hashes really make them particuarly useful, especially for new coders like us.

<p>
So there you have it. Hashes and arrays. They're basically step brothers. They clearly share the same DNA as at least one parents, but get a smathering of something different from the variable parent. Arrays are simple and regimented, hashes are loose and forgiving. Each has its own merits in specific situations, but this overview knowledge goes a long way towards knowing when to use each.
